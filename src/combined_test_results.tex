\section{Test Results: PWM \& Buck Converter}

Include test results (e.g. oscilloscope traces) which show that the converter operates correctly and satisfies the specifications. The results from the tests should be compared to the simulation results. Note the earlier simulations results may have to be changed to match the actual test conditions.

In addition to presenting the test results include an answer to the following questions:

    Do the test results and the simulation results agree? Comment on the results and especially any disagreement and the possible reasons for the disagreement.

    Provide a plot of converter output voltage vs. PWM reference voltage. Is this relationship as expected? Comment and explain.

    Measure the efficiency of the converter. How does the measured efficiency compare with the simulated efficiency and calculated efficiency? Comment and explain any differences.
