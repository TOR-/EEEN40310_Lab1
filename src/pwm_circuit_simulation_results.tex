\section{PWM Circuit Simulation Results}
\subsection{PWM Generator Simulation Results}
% The simulation results presented should validate that the design meets the specification.
% Include diagrams and figures to support your presentation of results.
% In addition to presenting the simulation results include an answer to the following questions. Make sure that the answers to the questions are clearly indicated in your report.
\subsubsection{Explain the design basis for the choice of op-amp power supply voltages, +Vs and -Vs? What is the minimum value which could be used for these?}

\subsubsection{What is the power consumption of the PWM circuit? What is this power used for?}

\subsubsection{What is the effect of the PWM circuit power consumption on the converter efficiency?}
%Quantify your answer.


\subsection{PWM Generator \& Buck Converter Results}
% The simulation results presented should validate that the design meets the specification.
% Include diagrams and figures to support your presentation of results.

% In addition to presenting the simulation results include an answer to the following questions. Make sure that the answers to the questions are clearly indicated in your report.
\subsubsection{What is the relationship between output voltage and reference voltage?}
% You could investigate this with a graph of output voltage vs. reference voltage.
\subsubsection{Could the same PWM circuit be used to drive the converter at 10 times your design frequency? What might limit the maximum frequency of operation of this circuit?}
