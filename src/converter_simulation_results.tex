\section{Converter Simulation Results}
% The simulation results presented should validate that the design meets the specification.

% Include diagrams and figures to support your presentation of results. 
% There should be a diagrams/figures that clearly show how the design specification have been met. 
% Ensure that all diagrams are legible, have axes with units and have captions which describe the diagram.

In addition to presenting the simulation results include an answer to the following questions. In your report clearly indicate the question and the answer.

\subsection{Questions}
\subsubsection{What is the minimum gate voltage that can be used to drive the high side switch?}
% Explain your answer.
\subsubsection{What would be the implications for the required high side switch gate voltages of if a PMOS switch is used instead of an NMOS?}
\subsubsection{In terms of how well the design meets the specifications, do the design calculations and results from the simulation agree?}

\subsubsection{What is the efficiency of the converter determined from the LTSpice simulation?}
% Note you can calculate power loss for components directly in LTSpice.

\subsubsection{Does this efficiency agree with the calculated efficiency? If not why not? What is different between the calculations and the simulation?}

\subsubsection{Under what conditions does the converter enter discontinuous conduction mode?}
