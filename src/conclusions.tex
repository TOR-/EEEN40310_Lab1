\section{Conclusions}

% For any technical report it is always good practice to provide a short conclusions section which might give a brief summary, and mention what have you learned.

In this lab we designed, simulated and built a buck converter and a PWM generator to operate the switch. At each stage of the process, errors appeared of varying magnitude, some of which were corrected, some of which were not. 

I learned two things during this lab: firstly I learned that oscillations in an electrical circuit can produce an audible effect, which was cool, even though it sounded like something was about to explode; secondly I learned that sometimes one and one makes two but it's so distorted it looks like an eight.
